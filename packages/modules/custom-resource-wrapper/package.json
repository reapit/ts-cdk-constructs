  "description": "This module helps write custom resource handlers. It's designed to work with the [Custom Resource Provider Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.CustomResource.html). It accepts an object which contains event handlers for `onCreate`, and optionally, `onUpdate`, and `onDelete`. Anything returned from `onCreate` and `onUpdate` is returned as data attributes on the resulting custom resource.",
